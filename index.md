### KPI Application (Internship - Summer 2020) 

During my internship, I developed a **KPI (i.e, "Key Performance Indicator") decision support application**, monitoring client projects based on Jira and internal resources.
This application was consulted **weekly by Scrum Masters and the PM team**.

**Technologies used**: Spring, Angular, Jenkins, Docker, MongoDB and SonarQube

The source files are available on my github at the following adresses:
